# Telegram-react for Franz
This is an adatption of the official Franz recipe for Telegram to use the 
more feature complete web client telegram-react (it can display this lovely animated stickers :D ).


## Installation 
Due to it's not in the official repository you need to copy the files of the plugin manually.

1. Create the folder
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/telegram-react`
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/telegram-react`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev/telegram-react`
2. Copy the files from this repository into the new folder
3. Reload Franz
4. Add Telegram-react by Add Service > Custom Service > Telegram-react

## Disclamer
This is just a quick hack so no guarantie for nothing. 
If you enjoy these animated stickers as I do feel free to send me a cup of coffee: https://ko-fi.com/geeks_r_us
